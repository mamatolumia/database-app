# Database Application

This repository contains a basic database application designed to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app is a great starting point for understanding how to interact with databases in a structured and efficient way.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, view, update, and delete user records.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless connection to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific records using keywords.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface with responsive layouts.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python/Node.js/Java
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Database_App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Database_App
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt   # For Python
   npm install                        # For Node.js
   ```

4. Configure the database:
   - Update the database connection settings in the configuration file (`config.py` or `.env`).
   - Run the database migrations (if needed):
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate         # For Python Django
     npm run migrate                  # For Node.js Sequelize
     ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py                     # For Python Flask/Django
   npm start                         # For Node.js
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.
